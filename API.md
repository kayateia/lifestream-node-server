## General notes

### Parameter types

This document mentions 3 different kinds of parameters.
- **Path component**: These parameters are part of the URL. For example, in _GET_ `api/image/:imageid`, `:imageid` is a path component specifying the numeric ID of the requested image.
- **Query string**: This is how parameters are passed when making _GET_ and _DELETE_ requests. These parameters are appended to the end of the URL. For example, in _GET_ `api/image/15?scaleTo=192&scaleMode=cover`, `scaleTo` and `scaleMode` are query string parameters.
- **Request body**: This is how parameters are passed when making _POST_ and _PUT_ requests. These parameters are received by the server as though they were fields included with a form submission.

### Stream permissions

A stream may have 1 of 3 kinds of permissions. Each permission type is mutually exclusive.
1. **Public**: Anyone may search for, view the contents of, and subscribe to the stream.
2. **Needs Approval**: Anyone may search for the stream, but cannot view images associated with the stream unless those images are associated with at least one _Public_ stream, or at least one other stream to which the viewing user is subscribed. Users cannot directly subscribe to the stream; they must first request an invite, which the stream owner then has to approve.
3. **Hidden**: The stream does not appear in search results, and nobody can view images associated with the stream unless those images are associated with at least one _Public_ stream, or at least one other stream to which the viewing user is subscribed.

### Failure conditions

Database errors may cause any request to fail, and are therefore always a potential failure condition. The **failure condition** sections below will make this assumption, and not explicitly mention database errors.

## Image

### POST api/image

Uploads an image file to the server and associates it with a stream. Optionally, a descriptive comment may also be associated with the image.

If an image needs to be associated with more than one stream, that can be achieved using subsequent calls to [POST api/image/:imageid/streams](#post-apiimageimageidstreams).

#### Parameters

- Request body:
	- **image**: Image file as _multipart/form-data_
	- **streamid**: Stream ID
	- **comment** _(optional)_: Comment text

#### Permissions

A user can upload an image to a stream they own.

**DEPRECATED:** A user can also upload an image to stream ID 1, the "Global Stream".

#### Result

If successful, the image is written to disk on the server, a notification is sen to all mobile clients watching the stream to which the image was uploaded, and the following response is sent:
```javascript
{
	"success": true,
	"id": /* (number) Image ID of newly uploaded file */
}
```

If the file already existed in the server's uploads directory, no changes are made to the server. The following response is sent:
```javascript
{
	"success": true
}
```

If unsuccessful, no changes are made on the server and the following response is sent:
```javascript
{
	"success": false,
	"error": /* (string) Error message */
}
```

#### Failure conditions

- Image could not be written to disk.

### GET api/image/:imageid

Downloads an image from the server. Optionally, a scaled-down version of the image may be requested.

#### Parameters

- Path component:
	- **imageid**: Image ID
- Query string:
	- **scaleTo** _(optional)_: Number of pixels. If the image is taller or wider than the specified number of pixels, it is scaled down before being sent to the client. This behavious is affected by `scaleMode`.
	- **scaleMode** _(optional)_: _cover_ or _contain_
		- **cover**: The size specified by `scaleTo` applies to the smaller dimension of the image. For example, if an image is originally 640x480 pixels, and `scaleTo` is 192, then the image would be scaled to 256x192 pixels.
		- **contain**: The size specified by `scaleTo` applies to the larger dimensionof the image. For example, if an image is 640x480 pixels, and `scaleTo` is 192, then the image would be scaled to 192x144 pixels.
		- If not specified, or if an invalid value is specified, the default behaviour is _contain_.

#### Permissions

The user who uploaded an image can always view their own image.

Anyone can view images that are associated with at least one _Public_ stream.

Users subscribed to at least one stream associated with a given image can view that image.

#### Result

If successful, the requested image is sent to the client.

If unsuccessful, the following response is sent:
```javascript
{
	"success": false,
	"error": /* (string) Error message */
}
```

#### Failure conditions

- Image could not be read from disk.
- Image could not be scaled as requested.
