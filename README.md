# LifeStream - Instant Photo Sharing ... in NodeJS

Copyright &copy; 2016 Kayateia and Deciare

## What is this?

**LifeStream** is a photo sharing service intended to be used in conjunction with a mobile client. The reference mobile client implementation is [LifeSharp](https://github.com/kayateia/lifesharp).

**lifestream-node-server** implements a [RESTful API](https://github.com/kayateia/lifestream-node-server/blob/master/API.md) with which clients interact in order to make use of the service. It also bundles a Web client that uses the API.

## Installation

Make a copy of `config.template.js` and modify it to suit your environment.

```bash
cp config.template.js config.js
```

Install dependencies from npm and bower.

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

You may also need to install **GraphicsMagick** on your host operating system if images don't appear in the gallery.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
node bin/www
```

For development, it is recommended to use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to automatically restart the server when code changes are made.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon
```

For production, it is recommended to use [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to immediately restart the server if it goes down.

```bash
npm install -g forever
forever -w --watchDirectory . --watchIgnore 'uploads/*' bin/www
```

## Database

By default, **lifestream-node-server** expects to connect to a **MySQL** database, and configuration options for that connection are in `config.js`.

There is an option to use **SQLite** instead, which may be simpler for development purposes. Due to concurrency issues, doing so is _not recommended_ for production use.

To enable SQLite, edit `config.js` to specify "sqlite" as the `databaseDriver`:

```javascript
	databaseDriver: "sqlite",
```

## Web client

By default, **lifestream-node-server** bundles a Web client that runs as part of the same node process as the APIs. If you wish, you can disable the Web client by editing `config.js`:

```javascript
	webClient: false,
```
